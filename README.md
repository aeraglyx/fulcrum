# Fulcrum

Blender addon containing random tools.

## 3D Stuff
- Basic setup for projection mapping
- Setup camera for isometric art
- Hybrid subdivision which combines *Simple* and *Catmull-Clark* algorithms
- Locate a single vertex or multiple vertices by its indices

## Node Stuff
- Compare speed of selected nodes and color them by their efficiency
- Show all nodes used by the selected node
- Show unused nodes in red
- Reset custom color of selected or all nodes
- Center nodes so their "center of mass" is at [0.0, 0.0]
- Align selected nodes to grid
- Encode current date and time to a node group, can be used as versioning

## Miscellaneous
- Automatically set *Time Limit* based on target render time of full animation
- Mass conversion of Vertex Groups to Vertex Colors
- Set mass of the whole object (instead of per vertex mass) in Cloth modifier
- Swatches for main colours in Vertex Paint mode
- Faster access to *Toggle System Console*
